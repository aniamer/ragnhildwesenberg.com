Shortly after I moved to Stockholm I had the pleasure to work out the cello arrangement for a song with Guillem Duquette, called 'El Alf√©izar'. We were sitting in the basement studio of La Casa Roja, him with his guitar and singing and me with my cello and pen and paper -a method that works well with songwriters who are not cellists: I take orders and give suggestions and we explore together.
