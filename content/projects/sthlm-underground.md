I'm a member of the Swedish hard rock band called sthlm underground. We are doing the band thing: rehearsing in a basement, playing gigs, recording and releasing our music.

Every Thursday we have a livestream where Karl-Johan Thenström, the band's singer and rhythm guitarist, gives a more or less shaky rendition of song requests from friends and fans. See the two of us in his studio here from one of these Thursdays:
