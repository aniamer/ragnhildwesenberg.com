I met Wilma while studying at the conservatory of Amsterdam, 2012-14, and we have kept in touch ever since. In 2015 she sent me the score of her Moon Suite, written for me and my carbon fibre cello. 
The seven movements are illustrated with a cycle of moon phases, starting and endind at nearly full moon;
l. Water/Ocean
ll. Nightshade 
lll. Belladonna 
lV. The Mermaid's Song 
V. Fugue 
Vl. To weave a rain of moondrops
Vll. Barcarolle 

The piece was premiered by Doris Hochscheid in Den Bosch (the Netherlands) in 2016, and by me in the medieval church St. Petri in Hadeland (Norway) in 2017.
