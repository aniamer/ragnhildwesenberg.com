I am a cellist. with degrees in performance and pedagogy, I play and teach. 
I'm a versatile performer, relating to the classical repertoire as well as the contemporary, and free improvisation. I've been hired to play in several weddings and funerals, to play at the opening of an art exhibition, background music at an association's anniversary, at the opening of a new season at a public library, and to instruct in improvisation with kids. I have given solo recitals of classical music, improvised at a festival with a balloon player, improvised as the only soundtrack to theater performances, and played pub gigs with a band in Manchester. 
In Stockholm, where I currently reside, I have played a Bach suite outdoors at a funeral ceremony, and I play in a hard rock band. 
I teach one-on-one, all levels and ages.
My languages are Norwegian, Swedish and English.
